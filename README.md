This is my Fall 2013 Operating Systems class initial project.

Working with TypeScript and Gulp!
=================================

TypeScript is a language that allows you to write in a statically-typed language that outputs standard JS!

Setup Gulp/TypeScript
=====================

1. Install NPM https://www.npmjs.org/
1. `npm install gulp`
1. `npm install tsc`
1. `npm install gulp-tsc`
1. `gulp` and you should see gulp run its magic and output some JS files!
